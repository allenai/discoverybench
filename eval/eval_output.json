Create a new column \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcid_in_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122(unique identifiers are called covariate in R) in RProjects_psychology_econ that will act as a unique id, fill it with those ids from the previous step where the first author appears only once.\n2. Next, Identify cases with double ids.\n    1. Identify the cases where the first author appears more than once in RP_data by finding instances where the length of IDs associated with a first author is greater than 1 and refer them as double IDs.\n    2. Extract the corresponding second author names where the first author is in more than one study. Match this second author names with the second author names in RProjects_psychology_econ\n    3. If a match is found (indicating that the same first author with a different second author is present in both datasets) assign the corresponding unique IDs from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ.

Handling Replicated Studies: Identify the cases where the same study was replicated more than once based on the second author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. Then associate these replicated studies with the corresponding first author names in RProjects_psychology_econ.\n4. Then match studies between RProjects_psychology_econ and RP_data based on their replication sample sizes by filtering the row where the first author appears in cases identified as having double IDs. Then extract the replication sample size (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) for these filtered rows. Match the replication sample size of the studies identified in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRProjects_psychology_econ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the corresponding studies in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRP_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, within the threshold of 5.

Then it assigns the matching id_in_data values from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ for cases where the replication sample sizes are similar.\n5. After updating the id_in_data column in RProjects_psychology_econ, this step merges RProjects_psychology_econ with RP_data based on the id_in_data column. It combines the datasets, ensuring that the relevant data from RP_data is included in RProjects_psychology_econ based on the matching id_in_data.\n\n## Post Joining\n\n1. After the merge, this part filters out rows from the merged dataset (RP_data_merged) where id_in_data is NA. These are likely cases where no matching data was found in RP_data. Then, it removes the first_author, second_author, and id_in_data columns, as they might not be needed for further analysis or may contain redundant information after merging. Filter RP_data_merged dataframe to remove rows where the study is P Bressan, D Stranieri and the value of the online.r column is 0.\n2. Modify the seniority.r column in the RP_data_merged dataframe and change any occurrence of Assistant to Assistant Professor. Create a new data frame not_complete_cases that contains only the rows from RP_data_merged where any of the remaining columns (after dropping the specified columns) have missing values or specific string values representing missing data.\n3. Filter out the rows from RP_data_merged where the study value corresponds to a study that has incomplete cases (missing values or specific string values representing missing data) based on the not_complete_cases data frame created in the previous step.\n\n## Function Inception and Analysis\n\n\n1.

    "WorkflowA": "## Initial Filtering\n\n1. import RP_data.csv (study data) and RProjects.csv (Replication Success Data)\n2. Filter the rows that contain the value \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrpp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and remove the rows that contain missing values in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceffect_size.o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceffect_size.r\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n3. Create first and second author columns in the dataframe.\n4. Create a new dataframe named \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRProjects_psychology_econ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by collecting the rows from RProjects data that has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcExperimental Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPsychology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the project and create first and second author columns.\n5. Identify the ids where first author names match between RProjects_psychology_econ and RProjects data.\n\n## Create Unique Identifier to merge the two data\n\n1. Create a new column \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcid_in_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122(unique identifiers are called covariate in R) in RProjects_psychology_econ that will act as a unique id, fill it with those ids from the previous step where the first author appears only once.\n2. Next, Identify cases with double ids.\n    1. Identify the cases where the first author appears more than once in RP_data by finding instances where the length of IDs associated with a first author is greater than 1 and refer them as double IDs.\n    2. Extract the corresponding second author names where the first author is in more than one study. Match this second author names with the second author names in RProjects_psychology_econ\n    3. If a match is found (indicating that the same first author with a different second author is present in both datasets) assign the corresponding unique IDs from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ. This ensures that each unique combination of first and second authors is correctly linked between the two datasets.\n3. Handling Replicated Studies: Identify the cases where the same study was replicated more than once based on the second author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. Then associate these replicated studies with the corresponding first author names in RProjects_psychology_econ.\n4. Then match studies between RProjects_psychology_econ and RP_data based on their replication sample sizes by filtering the row where the first author appears in cases identified as having double IDs. Then extract the replication sample size (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) for these filtered rows. Match the replication sample size of the studies identified in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRProjects_psychology_econ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the corresponding studies in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRP_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, within the threshold of 5. It aims to find the matching studies in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRP_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 based on their replication sample size. Then it assigns the matching id_in_data values from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ for cases where the replication sample sizes are similar.\n5. After updating the id_in_data column in RProjects_psychology_econ, this step merges RProjects_psychology_econ with RP_data based on the id_in_data column. It combines the datasets, ensuring that the relevant data from RP_data is included in RProjects_psychology_econ based on the matching id_in_data.\n\n## Post Joining\n\n1. After the merge, this part filters out rows from the merged dataset (RP_data_merged) where id_in_data is NA. These are likely cases where no matching data was found in RP_data. Then, it removes the first_author, second_author, and id_in_data columns, as they might not be needed for further analysis or may contain redundant information after merging. Filter RP_data_merged dataframe to remove rows where the study is P Bressan, D Stranieri and the value of the online.r column is 0.\n2. Modify the seniority.r column in the RP_data_merged dataframe and change any occurrence of Assistant to Assistant Professor. Create a new data frame not_complete_cases that contains only the rows from RP_data_merged where any of the remaining columns (after dropping the specified columns) have missing values or specific string values representing missing data.\n3. Filter out the rows from RP_data_merged where the study value corresponds to a study that has incomplete cases (missing values or specific string values representing missing data) based on the not_complete_cases data frame created in the previous step.\n\n## Function Inception and Analysis\n\n\n1. Create a function describe_factor_function that takes a dataframe, variable and a default name and returns a dataframe\n2. Group the project.x variable, and count the number of occurences for each level and set it as a character.\n3. Convert the format into e.g. (n (45)%) and it remove the original count column (n)\n4. Reshape the data from a long format to a wide format, creating new columns for each project, with the values being the formatted count\nand percentage strings ('n (%)') for each level of the variable.\n5. Create a new column - Covariate, where the name is passed or its 'Var' and all the row values are empty strings\n6. Reorder the columns, putting the Covariate column first, followed by all other columns.\n\n7. For the second set of hypotheses (H10 - H20), it creates factor_covariates\n(Discipline, Max seniority of authors (O),\n    Max seniority of authors (R),\n    Type of compensation (O),\n    Type of compensation (R),\n    Type of subjects (O),\n    Type of subjects (R),\n    Country of original experiment,\n    Country of replication experiment,\n    Same language (O&R),\n    Same country (O&R),\n    Both conducted on/offline (O&R),\n    Same type of subjects (O&R),\n    Lab in the US (O),\n    Lab in the US (R))\n\n8. Generate a sequence of integers corresponding to the indices of elements in the vector continuous_covariates. \n9. Apply an anonymous function, function(i) {...}, to each integer in that sequence. Inside the function, factor_covariates[i] retrieves the name of a variable from the factor_covariates vector using the index i.\n10. Call the describe_factor_function and apply it to each element of the factor_covariates vector, passing the variable name and its corresponding name as arguments.\n11. lapply returns a list where each element is the data frame returned by describe_factor_function for each variable in factor_covariates.\n12. Use do.call that invokes the bind_rows function from the dplyr package, passing the list of data frames as its argument. The bind_rows function combines (row-binds) all the data frames in the list into a single data frame.\n13. Format all numeric columns by rounding the values to 2 significant digits and adding a thousands separator (')",

    "WorkflowA": "## Initial Filtering\n\n1. import RP_data.csv (study data) and RProjects.csv (Replication Success Data)\n2. Filter the rows that contain the value \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrpp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and remove the rows that contain missing values in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceffect_size.o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceffect_size.r\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n3. Create first and second author columns in the dataframe.\n4. Create a new dataframe named \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRProjects_psychology_econ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by collecting the rows from RProjects data that has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcExperimental Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPsychology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the project and create first and second author columns.\n5. Identify the ids where first author names match between RProjects_psychology_econ and RProjects data.\n\n## Create Unique Identifier to merge the two data\n\n1. Create a new column \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcid_in_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122(unique identifiers are called covariate in R) in RProjects_psychology_econ that will act as a unique id, fill it with those ids from the previous step where the first author appears only once.\n2. Next, Identify cases with double ids.\n    1. Identify the cases where the first author appears more than once in RP_data by finding instances where the length of IDs associated with a first author is greater than 1 and refer them as double IDs.\n    2. Extract the corresponding second author names where the first author is in more than one study. Match this second author names with the second author names in RProjects_psychology_econ\n    3. If a match is found (indicating that the same first author with a different second author is present in both datasets) assign the corresponding unique IDs from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ. This ensures that each unique combination of first and second authors is correctly linked between the two datasets.\n3. Handling Replicated Studies: Identify the cases where the same study was replicated more than once based on the second author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. Then associate these replicated studies with the corresponding first author names in RProjects_psychology_econ.\n4. Then match studies between RProjects_psychology_econ and RP_data based on their replication sample sizes by filtering the row where the first author appears in cases identified as having double IDs. Then extract the replication sample size (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) for these filtered rows. Match the replication sample size of the studies identified in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRProjects_psychology_econ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the corresponding studies in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRP_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, within the threshold of 5. It aims to find the matching studies in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRP_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 based on their replication sample size. Then it assigns the matching id_in_data values from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ for cases where the replication sample sizes are similar.\n5. After updating the id_in_data column in RProjects_psychology_econ, this step merges RProjects_psychology_econ with RP_data based on the id_in_data column. It combines the datasets, ensuring that the relevant data from RP_data is included in RProjects_psychology_econ based on the matching id_in_data.\n\n## Post Joining\n\n1. After the merge, this part filters out rows from the merged dataset (RP_data_merged) where id_in_data is NA. These are likely cases where no matching data was found in RP_data. Then, it removes the first_author, second_author, and id_in_data columns, as they might not be needed for further analysis or may contain redundant information after merging. Filter RP_data_merged dataframe to remove rows where the study is P Bressan, D Stranieri and the value of the online.r column is 0.\n2. Modify the seniority.r column in the RP_data_merged dataframe and change any occurrence of Assistant to Assistant Professor. Create a new data frame not_complete_cases that contains only the rows from RP_data_merged where any of the remaining columns (after dropping the specified columns) have missing values or specific string values representing missing data.\n3. Filter out the rows from RP_data_merged where the study value corresponds to a study that has incomplete cases (missing values or specific string values representing missing data) based on the not_complete_cases data frame created in the previous step.\n\n## Function Inception and Analysis\n\n\n1. Create a function describe_factor_function that takes a dataframe, variable and a default name and returns a dataframe\n2. Group the project.x variable, and count the number of occurences for each level and set it as a character.\n3. Convert the format into e.g. (n (45)%) and it remove the original count column (n)\n4. Reshape the data from a long format to a wide format, creating new columns for each project, with the values being the formatted count\nand percentage strings ('n (%)') for each level of the variable.\n5. Create a new column - Covariate, where the name is passed or its 'Var' and all the row values are empty strings\n6. Reorder the columns, putting the Covariate column first, followed by all other columns.\n\n7. For the second set of hypotheses (H10 - H20), it creates factor_covariates\n(Discipline, Max seniority of authors (O),\n    Max seniority of authors (R),\n    Type of compensation (O),\n    Type of compensation (R),\n    Type of subjects (O),\n    Type of subjects (R),\n    Country of original experiment,\n    Country of replication experiment,\n    Same language (O&R),\n    Same country (O&R),\n    Both conducted on/offline (O&R),\n    Same type of subjects (O&R),\n    Lab in the US (O),\n    Lab in the US (R))\n\n8. Generate a sequence of integers corresponding to the indices of elements in the vector continuous_covariates. \n9. Apply an anonymous function, function(i) {...}, to each integer in that sequence. Inside the function, factor_covariates[i] retrieves the name of a variable from the factor_covariates vector using the index i.\n10. Call the describe_factor_function and apply it to each element of the factor_covariates vector, passing the variable name and its corresponding name as arguments.\n11. lapply returns a list where each element is the data frame returned by describe_factor_function for each variable in factor_covariates.\n12. Use do.call that invokes the bind_rows function from the dplyr package, passing the list of data frames as its argument. The bind_rows function combines (row-binds) all the data frames in the list into a single data frame.\n13. Format all numeric columns by rounding the values to 2 significant digits and adding a thousands separator (')",

Data Filtering: Filtered both datasets for the period between 3400 BCE to 3000 BCE based on the CE column in 'time_series_data' and converted BCE to CE in 'capital_data'.\n4. Data Cleaning: Converted Z values in 'capital_data' from string to float and interpolated missing values for 'MonumentCount' and 'AxesCelts' in 'time_series_data'.\n5.

Correlation Analysis: Calculated the correlation between the interpolated 'MonumentCount' and 'AxesCelts' and the Z scores 'ZMonument' and 'ZBeil' to understand their relationships.\n\nFINAL ANSWER:\n\nBetween 3400 BCE and 3000 BCE, the number of monuments and axes, which are indicators of symbolic capital, shows a strong positive relationship with elements of symbolic capital. As the Z scores for monuments and axes increase, indicating an increase in symbolic capital, the actual interpolated counts of monuments and axes also increase. This relationship is supported by a correlation near 1 for both monuments and axes with their respective Z scores. However, this analysis does not establish causation, and further research would be required to explore the causal dynamics of this relationship.",

    "WorkflowA": "## Initial Filtering\n\n1. import RP_data.csv (study data) and RProjects.csv (Replication Success Data)\n2. Filter the rows that contain the value \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcee\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcrpp\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 and remove the rows that contain missing values in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceffect_size.o\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dceffect_size.r\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.\n3. Create first and second author columns in the dataframe.\n4. Create a new dataframe named \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRProjects_psychology_econ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 by collecting the rows from RProjects data that has \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcExperimental Economics\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 or \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcPsychology\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 as the project and create first and second author columns.\n5. Identify the ids where first author names match between RProjects_psychology_econ and RProjects data.\n\n## Create Unique Identifier to merge the two data\n\n1. Create a new column \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcid_in_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122(unique identifiers are called covariate in R) in RProjects_psychology_econ that will act as a unique id, fill it with those ids from the previous step where the first author appears only once.\n2. Next, Identify cases with double ids.\n    1. Identify the cases where the first author appears more than once in RP_data by finding instances where the length of IDs associated with a first author is greater than 1 and refer them as double IDs.\n    2. Extract the corresponding second author names where the first author is in more than one study. Match this second author names with the second author names in RProjects_psychology_econ\n    3. If a match is found (indicating that the same first author with a different second author is present in both datasets) assign the corresponding unique IDs from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ. This ensures that each unique combination of first and second authors is correctly linked between the two datasets.\n3. Handling Replicated Studies: Identify the cases where the same study was replicated more than once based on the second author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s name. Then associate these replicated studies with the corresponding first author names in RProjects_psychology_econ.\n4. Then match studies between RProjects_psychology_econ and RP_data based on their replication sample sizes by filtering the row where the first author appears in cases identified as having double IDs. Then extract the replication sample size (\u00e2\u20ac\u02dcnr\u00e2\u20ac\u2122) for these filtered rows. Match the replication sample size of the studies identified in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRProjects_psychology_econ\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 with the corresponding studies in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRP_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122, within the threshold of 5. It aims to find the matching studies in \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcRP_data\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 based on their replication sample size. Then it assigns the matching id_in_data values from RP_data to RProjects_psychology_econ for cases where the replication sample sizes are similar.\n5. After updating the id_in_data column in RProjects_psychology_econ, this step merges RProjects_psychology_econ with RP_data based on the id_in_data column. It combines the datasets, ensuring that the relevant data from RP_data is included in RProjects_psychology_econ based on the matching id_in_data.\n\n## Post Joining\n\n1. After the merge, this part filters out rows from the merged dataset (RP_data_merged) where id_in_data is NA. These are likely cases where no matching data was found in RP_data. Then, it removes the first_author, second_author, and id_in_data columns, as they might not be needed for further analysis or may contain redundant information after merging. Filter RP_data_merged dataframe to remove rows where the study is P Bressan, D Stranieri and the value of the online.r column is 0.\n2. Modify the seniority.r column in the RP_data_merged dataframe and change any occurrence of Assistant to Assistant Professor. Create a new data frame not_complete_cases that contains only the rows from RP_data_merged where any of the remaining columns (after dropping the specified columns) have missing values or specific string values representing missing data.\n3. Filter out the rows from RP_data_merged where the study value corresponds to a study that has incomplete cases (missing values or specific string values representing missing data) based on the not_complete_cases data frame created in the previous step.\n\n## Function Inception and Analysis\n\n1. Create a describe_continuous_function that takes a dataframe, a variable and returns a dataframe\n2. Group the project.x column and rename it to Project and For each group(project), the function calculates the mean, minimum, and maximum values of the variable specified by the variable argument using the get() function..\n3. Summarize the data is reshaped from a long format to a wide format using pivot_wider().\n4. The column names for the new columns are taken from the project column, values are the ones just computed.\n5. Select the columns containing the average, minimum, and maximum values for the project named 'Experimental Economics', followed by all other columns in the data frame (everything()).\n\n6. For the first set of hypotheses (H1 - H9), create continuous covariates:\nnames(continuous_covariates) <-\n  c(p-value (O),\n    Effect estimate on Fisher-z scale (O),\n    Effect estimate on Fisher-z scale (R),\n    Power (O),\n    Planned power (R),\n    Original paper length (nb pages),\n    Nb citations (O),\n    Nb authors (O), Nb authors (R),\n    Avg author citations (O), Avg author citations (R),\n    Max author citations (O), Max author citations (R),\n    Ratio authors male (O), Ratio authors male (R))\n\n7. Generate a sequence of integers corresponding to the indices of elements in the vector continuous_covariates. \n8. Apply an anonymous function, function(i) {...}, to each integer in that sequence. Inside the function, continuous_covariates[i] retrieves the name of a variable from the continuous_covariates vector using the index i.\n9. Use do.call that invokes the bind_rows function from the dplyr package, passing the list of data frames as its argument. The bind_rows function combines (row-binds) all the data frames in the list into a single data frame.\n10. Format all numeric columns by rounding the values to 2 significant digits and adding a thousands separator (')",
