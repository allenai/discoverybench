The dataset contains information of two groups of countries- Sub-Saharan Africa and Lower Middle Income Countries (LMC) from 1975 to 2015, sourced from the World Development Indicators (WDI) database. It focuses on the relationship between government expenditure on education (% of total expenditure) and per capita GDP (in 2010 US$), using variables like total labor force, gross primary and secondary enrollment, and exports (annual % growth) as key indicators.",
